/**
 * This is the component, used alongside each <code>TaskShell</code>, which
 * defines a task's replication group.<BR>
 * This class provides methods to manage the information a specific task
 * possesses about its replication group in terms of replicant (un)registration,
 * that is it maintains up to date the number of replicants for this particular
 * task and the location of each replicant.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * NB: EVERY replicant, independently of its being leader of the replication
 * group or not, carries and maintains this information up to date so as to be
 * available to take the leadership in case of the current leader's failure.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * NB2: This class is abstract; its specialisations define the current
 * replication policy within the task's group, and therefore the message passing
 * and runtime management schemes.
